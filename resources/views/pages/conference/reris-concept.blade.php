                    With more than 600 million Africans living without access to electricity and over 730 million relying on dangerous, inefficient forms of cooking, 
                    fast but sustainable development of African renewable energy markets is needed. Applied research and innovative business roll-outs play a key role in boosting this development, 
                    helping to secure energy supply in both rural and urban areas, increase generation capacities and energy system resilience.

                    With the aim to foster research cooperation on renewable energy – both between universities in Africa and Europe and between academia, 
                    private and public sector - the Africa-EU Renewable Energy Cooperation Programme (RECP) and the National University of Lesotho (NUL) are jointly 
                    organising the second Africa-EU Symposium on Renewable Energy Research and Innovation (RERIS 2018) from 23–27 January 2018 in Maseru, Lesotho. 
                    The symposium will take place on the occasion of the NUL International Science and Technology Innovation Conference and Expo (NULSTICE 2018).
