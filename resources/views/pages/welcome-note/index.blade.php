                              University of Lesotho International Science, Technology and Innovation Conference and Expo
                               (NULSTICE 2020, a bi-annual event. Unlike NULISTICE 2018, this year’s event is much more 
                               focused but no less important. It includes (a) An Expo at the Pioneer Mall, (b) The NUL 
                               Innovation Hub_ Vodacom Hackathon at the NUL and (c) the Gala Dinner at Maseru Avani.

                              Through NULISTICE, our primary objective remains the same— to encourage the spirit of 
                              entrepreneurship among our staff members, students and graduates and to expose their innovation 
                              and creativity to the outside world with the sole aim of creating sustainable jobs to curb youth
